# Stone Game VIII

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Hard-red)

## Problem

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with  **Alice starting first**.

There are `n` stones arranged in a row. On each player's turn, while the number of stones is  **more than one**, they will do the following:

- Choose an integer x > 1, and remove the leftmost x stones from the row.
- Add the sum of the removed stones' values to the player's score.
- Place a new stone, whose value is equal to that sum, on the left side of the row.

The game stops when  **only**   **one**  stone is left in the row.

The  **score difference**  between Alice and Bob is `(Alice's score - Bob's score)`. Alice's goal is to  **maximize**  the score difference, and Bob's goal is the  **minimize**  the score difference.

Given an integer array `stones` of length `n` where `stones[i]` represents the value of the `ith` stone  **from the left**, return  *the  **score difference**  between Alice and Bob if they both play  **optimally**.* 

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: stones = [-1,2,-3,4,-5]
Output: 5
Explanation:
- Alice removes the first 4 stones, adds (-1) + 2 + (-3) + 4 = 2 to her score, and places a stone of
  value 2 on the left. stones = [2,-5].
- Bob removes the first 2 stones, adds 2 + (-5) = -3 to his score, and places a stone of value -3 on
  the left. stones = [-3].
The difference between their scores is 2 - (-3) = 5.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: stones = [7,-6,5,10,5,-2,-6]
Output: 13
Explanation:
- Alice removes all stones, adds 7 + (-6) + 5 + 10 + 5 + (-2) + (-6) = 13 to her score, and places a
  stone of value 13 on the left. stones = [13].
The difference between their scores is 13 - 0 = 13.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: stones = [-10,-12]
Output: -22
Explanation:
- Alice can only make one move, which is to remove both stones. She adds (-10) + (-12) = -22 to her
  score and places a stone of value -22 on the left. stones = [-22].
The difference between their scores is (-22) - 0 = -22.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- n == stones.length
- 2 <= n <= 105
- -104 <= stones[i] <= 104

        int[] prefix = stones.clone();

        // Build prefix sums

            prefix[i] += prefix[i - 1];
        }

        // If Alice takes all stones,
        // the game ends immediately.
        int best = prefix[n - 1];

        // Try every earlier valid prefix
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 1; i--) {
            best = Math.max(best, prefix[i] - best);
        }

        return best;
    }
}
